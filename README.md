# Power & Gas Options FO Desk – From Market Quotes to Hedging

This repository is a front-office style implementation of a power/gas options desk workflow.

The goal is not to build a complex model, but to demonstrate how models are used
to support real trading decisions on a commodity options desk, including:

- how market option quotes are interpreted
- how implied volatility is extracted from prices
- how Black–Scholes is used as a pricing and risk tool (not a forecasting model)
- how prices, Greeks, and P&L attribution support trader hedging decisions
