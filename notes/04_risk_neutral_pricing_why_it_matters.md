# Why Risk-Neutral Pricing Matters (Even If It's Not Reality)

---

## 1. The apparent paradox

- Markets are not risk-neutral
- BS assumptions are false
- Yet all pricing uses risk-neutral valuation

Why?

---

## 2. Risk-neutral measure is a pricing tool, not a belief

Risk-neutral pricing means:

> Prices are such that no arbitrage exists

It does NOT say:
- Investors are risk-neutral
- The world behaves this way

It only says:
- You can reweight probabilities to price assets consistently

---

## 3. Why not use real-world probabilities?

Because:
- Risk preferences differ
- They are unobservable
- They do not lead to unique prices

Only risk-neutral pricing gives:
- Unique prices
- Hedgeable replication arguments

---

## 4. BS role in this framework

BS:
- Implements risk-neutral pricing under lognormal assumption
- Provides tractable pricing and Greeks
- Acts as a reference model

---

## 5. How traders actually think

Traders do NOT believe BS.
They believe:
- Market prices
- Vol surfaces
- No-arbitrage relationships

BS is just the translator.
